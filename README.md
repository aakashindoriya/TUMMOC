   - Add the following key-value pair to the `.env` file:
     ```
     REACT_APP_BASEURL="http://localhost:8080"
     ```
   - This sets the base URL for the frontend to `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Server Setup:
   - Create a `.env` file in the server directory.
   - Add the following key-value pairs to the `.env` file:
     ```
     MONGOURL="your-mongo-url"
     SESSIONSEC="aakash"
     JWT_SECRET="aaksh123"
     JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="dadidado"

   - Replace `your-mongo-url` with the URL of your MongoDB instance.
   - These environment variables are required for the server to function properly.
